# Model Comparisons

For this simple project I want to compare the accuracy of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network for Classification and Regression.  I will be using Forex data on a 5 minute tick.  The goal is to build a model using ~1000 ticks of data and then simulate live streaming data.  I will use the live streaming data to update the models and make a prediction on every new tick.  I will have another ~1000 ticks of data for my simulated live streaming.
